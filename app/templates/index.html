            <p>
                I live in a small town in southeast Michigan where there are many cloudy, rainy, foggy and snowy days to inspire me.
                I love to paint clouds; big or small, soft and warm, in every color combination I can think of. I paint with the canvas 
                flat on my kitchen table using a palette knife to layer and blend the paint in warm and cool colors for a contrast 
                between light and shadows. I work from memory and imagination, using color and light to convey mood and atmosphere.
